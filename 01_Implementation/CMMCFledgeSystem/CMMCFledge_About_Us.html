                        Hello, thank you for taking the time not only to check out the CMMC fledge website but to learn more about the team behind it! 
                        My name is Connor McFarren and this is a solo project developed by myself. CMMCFledge serves as my capstone for my undergraduate 
                        Cybersecurity degree at Christopher Newport University (CNU). I plan to further my education after graduation and work towards my masters in the following years.
                        </br></br>
                        I hope the information presented through the CMMCFledge website has been both informative and helpful. 
                        The motivation behind this project was to try and support local/small businesses to become CMMC certified. 
                        By taking the assessment, it was my plan to make CMMC less daunting and seem like something every business could accomplish. 
                        By interacting with the assessment, I hope that you found results that point you and your business in the right direction 
                        without a single dime spent or the pressure of continued assistance at a cost.
                        </br></br>
                        Though it may still look like a student project, I believe that the work and motivation behind the project bleeds through. 
                        In the future in hope to continue designing the feel of the website and improving upon the assessment.
                        </br></br>
